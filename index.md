#### I'm Rene

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/renaynay), working on [lazy ledger](https://github.com/celestiaorg/lazyledger-core), previously at [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), and before that, [whiteblock](https://github.com/whiteblock/genesis).

I like the Badlands in South Dakota, Golang, hot sauce, and learning about all things distributed systems.

#### I believe
Black Lives [Matter](https://org2.salsalabs.com/o/6857/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=15780&_ga=2.145232500.1514722357.1592322097-475186111.1592322097) and the Black Hills belong to the [Lakota](https://bhlegalfund.org/#about).

Networking, peer-to-peer and distributed systems, and hot peppers.
