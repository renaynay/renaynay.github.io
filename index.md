#### I'm Rene

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/renaynay), working on [lazy ledger](https://github.com/celestiaorg/lazyledger-core), previously at [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), and before that, [whiteblock](https://github.com/whiteblock/genesis).

I like the Badlands in South Dakota, Golang, hot sauce, and learning about all things distributed systems.

#### I enjoy learning about
Networking, peer-to-peer and distributed systems, and hot peppers.

#### Check out
My [blog](https://blog.rene.sh) where I sometimes write about something new I've learned.
