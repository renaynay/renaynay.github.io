#### I'm Rene

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/renaynay). 

I like the Badlands in South Dakota, Golang, hot sauce, and learning about all things distributed systems.

#### I believe
Black Lives [Matter](https://org2.salsalabs.com/o/6857/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=15780&_ga=2.145232500.1514722357.1592322097-475186111.1592322097).

#### I like working with
Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Postgres, and sometimes (mostly never) Ruby.

#### I enjoy learning about
Networking, peer-to-peer and distributed systems, and hot peppers.

#### I have fun
Making hot sauces, [implementing](https://github.com/renaynay/go-hobbits) light wire protocols in Go and taking [photos](https://www.instagram.com/renenayman/).

#### Check out
My [blog](https://blog.rene.sh) where I write about something new I learn each week.
